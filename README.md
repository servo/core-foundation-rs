# core-foundation-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/servo/core-foundation-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/servo/core-foundation-rs)

## Compatibility

Targets macOS 10.7 by default.

To enable features added in macOS 10.8, set Cargo feature `mac_os_10_8_features`. To have both 10.8 features and 10.7 compatibility, also set `mac_os_10_7_support`. Setting both requires weak linkage, which is a nightly-only feature as of Rust 1.19.

For more experimental but more complete, generated bindings take a look at https://github.com/michaelwu/RustKit.
Other alternatives are https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity and https://gitlab.com/objrs/objrs
